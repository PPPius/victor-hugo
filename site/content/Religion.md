Religion was very important to the Mayan Civilisations, just like all the other major ancient civilisations, in fact the beliefs of the Mayans were very similar to that of the Aztecs and Incas. 
The Ancient Mayans were polytheists and each God was very important to them. In Maya mythology, Chac (sometimes spelled "Chaac") was the god of rain and thunder, and important as a fertility and agriculture god. 
To the Mayans he was one of the most important God as they believed without him they would have no crops would not be fertile.
 Other important Gods in the Mayan Civilisation were the God of Sun (Kinich Ahau), The Maize god (	Yumil Kaxob) is representative of the ripe grain which was the base of the Mayan agriculture.
 These were the main Gods in Mayan societies. The Mayan people built large temples and buildings in honour of these Gods and here they offered human sacrifice as the ritual offering of nourishment to the Gods, as they believed that blood was a source of nourishment to them.
