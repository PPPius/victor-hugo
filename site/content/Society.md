Above is an example of the Class system pyramid of the Ancient Mayan Civilisation.
Mayan Society was broken up into 5 main classes, they were: The King, Nobles, Priests, Common People or Farmers and the lowest rank was 
the Slaves. The most powerful position was obviousouly the King, whose power and rights were passed down his heridatry line. He was so 
honoured and feared that whenever he was speaking to anyone below his rank a cloth was held before his face.  Priests were also held in high
stead due to the fact that they were also able mathematicians, astronomers and scholars. They were quite revered and they were responible 
for handling the human sacrificial offerings to the God. Priests took advantage of the beliefs of the people and could manipulate who was 
sacrificed to the Gods. At the bottom of society are the Common People and Slaves. The Common People spent most of their lives as farmers or craftspeople. They were the people who worked long hours to help provide stability in the economy of the Mayans. Slaves were either prisoners of war, people who were caught stealing or old slaves children. These people spent their entire lives serving the nobility and were never treated fairly.
