Above is a photo of the Chilam Balam, much of what we know about the Government systems of the Mayans is derived from this book.
The Ancient Mayans government system was a Hierarchical system.
Each city state was to be ruled by one king, and around him were his councils who were chosen from a range of noble families. 
The king was considered to be chosen by the gods and was considered to be the mediator between the gods and the people that lived in the civilisation. 
The priests were also considered to be as powerful as kings. 
The kings even came to the priests for advice on how to deal with a crisis, hence the priests had great control over how a city state was ruled. 
The king was called the “ahaw”, the military leaders were known as the “nacom” and the king’s council were known as the “batab”. 
At the peak of the Mayan Civilisation there was 100s of city states, each with its own king. 
The king was expected to serve as a military and give blood sacrifices to the gods, once a king died his child would take over no matter what the age of the child was. 
The king’s main responsibility however, was to ensure the continual growth and expansion of his city state.
